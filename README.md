1. Set up a MySQL server or use an existing installation.
2. Create a new database named "unemployed_db" using a MySQL client or command line.
3. Import the database schema and tables into the "unemployed_db" database.
4. Connect to the "self-employed" database from your application using the appropriate connection parameters.
5. Use SQL queries to perform CRUD operations on the tables and implement the desired functionality.

Make sure to customize the database configuration and access permissions based on your specific environment and security requirements.
